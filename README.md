## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The application is built with a **decoupled frontend and backend**, communicating via REST API.
The core logic is handled by a team of AI agents:

1. **User Input:** The user provides a stock ticker, risk level, and budget through the Streamlit interface.
2. **Data Collection:** The Data Agent fetches historical stock data, while the News Agent scrapes recent headlines.
3. **Sentiment Analysis:** The Sentiment Agent uses FinBERT to determine if market sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.
4. **Agentic Response:** All this data is passed to the Decision Agent, which uses an LLM (like Google Gemini Pro) to produce a reasoned investment recommendation.
5. **Display:** The final advice, charts, and sentiment scores are presented in the chat interface.
